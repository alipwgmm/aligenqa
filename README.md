# aligenqa

aligenqa is based on tools originally developed by Christian Bourjau
within the HMTF.
It is now adapted to general generator-level QA in ALICE.

The goal is to monitor the MC generators along their updates and versions.
The focus is given to final-state particles and is based on a set of "centrally" predefined histograms.
The outcome is published on an ALICE internal web page (pdf + root files)
